# Vanguard-ETF-Anaylsis
This small python program uses matplotlib and numpy to analyze 2017 and older ETF data parsed from Kaggle. Further documentation inside of docstring.

The point of this program is to build it out into a visualization program for the entire data file and allow a user to pass their own CSV stock data in
the accepted format and create good looking graphs for reports or analysis. 

V1.0 : Two graphics built and verified using cleaned up data for VTI VOO and VXUS
V1.1 (expected): incorporate usable graph for Volume data and create an animation for each graph to build itself over time
